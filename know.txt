# Project Knowledge: DSA Text Editor & Visualizer

## Overview
This project is a web-based text editor that features real-time data structure visualizations. It is designed to help users understand how various data structures work by visualizing their behavior as the user interacts with the text editor.

## Technologies Used
- **Frontend:** JavaScript (ES6 modules), HTML, CSS
- **Build Tool:** Vite (for development and production builds)
- **Visualization:** HTML5 Canvas (for drawing data structure states)
- **Backend Logic:**
  - **C (src/c/):** Contains C implementations of data structures (Trie, Stack, Linked List, Hash Map, Graph). These are intended for WebAssembly (WASM) integration, but are currently valid C code and not yet linked to the frontend.
  - **JavaScript (src/js/):** Main application logic, text editor, and data structure visualizers.
- **Dictionary:** A plain text dictionary file (public/dictionary.txt) is used for Trie operations and word prediction.

## Project Structure
- `index.html`: Main HTML entry point, sets up the UI and loads scripts/styles.
- `main.js`: Entry point for frontend logic.
- `style.css`: Main stylesheet for the application.
- `public/`: Static assets (dictionary, WASM, etc.)
- `src/`
  - `js/`: JavaScript source code
    - `TextEditor.js`: Core text editor logic (undo/redo, cursor, prediction events)
    - `Predictor.js`: N-gram (Markov Chain) text prediction model
    - `utils.js`: Utility functions (cursor management, debouncing, word frequency, etc.)
    - `visualizers/`: Data structure visualizers (Stack, Linked List, Hash Map, Trie, Graph, Gap Buffer)
  - `c/`: C source code for data structures (Trie, Stack, Linked List, Hash Map, Graph)

## Key Features
- **Text Editor:**
  - Undo/redo functionality (visualized as stacks)
  - Cursor management
  - Real-time text prediction using an N-gram model
- **Data Structure Visualizations:**
  - **Stack:** Visualizes undo/redo stacks
  - **Linked List:** Visualizes text as a linked list of character chunks
  - **Hash Map:** Visualizes word frequency
  - **Trie:** Visualizes dictionary words and supports search/insert
  - **Graph:** Visualizes unique words as nodes
  - **Gap Buffer:** Visualizes the gap buffer technique for efficient text editing
- **Dictionary Integration:**
  - Loads a dictionary from a text file for Trie operations and prediction

## How It Works
- The frontend is built with JavaScript and uses HTML5 Canvas for visualizations.
- The text editor emits events (change, undo, redo, cursor move, predict) that update the visualizers in real time.
- The Predictor uses an N-gram model to suggest next words based on the current text.
- Visualizers are modular and update their state based on the text editor's content.
- C code for data structures is present for potential WASM integration, but is not currently connected to the frontend.

## Build & Run
- Install dependencies: `npm install`
- Start development server: `npm run dev`
- Build for production: `npm run build`

## Notes
- The C backend is not yet integrated; all visualizations and logic currently run in JavaScript.
- The project is modular and can be extended to use WASM for performance or educational purposes.
