# Project Summary

## Implementation Status: ✅ COMPLETE

All 14 features have been successfully implemented with appropriate data structures.

## Features Implemented

### ✅ BASIC FEATURES (4/4)
1. ✅ Insert and delete text using Doubly Linked List
2. ✅ Cursor movement (left, right, up, down) using Doubly Linked List
3. ✅ Search for a word using array-based string matching
4. ✅ Word count and character count using simple traversal

### ✅ INTERMEDIATE FEATURES (4/4)
5. ✅ Undo and Redo functionality using two Stacks
6. ✅ Copy, Cut, and Paste operations using Queue/Array
7. ✅ Find and Replace using string algorithms
8. ✅ Line-wise text editing using Linked List of strings

### ✅ ADVANCED FEATURES (6/6)
9. ✅ Auto-save functionality using Queue
10. ✅ Basic syntax highlighting using Hash table simulation
11. ✅ Spell checker using Trie
12. ✅ Bracket matching using Stack
13. ✅ Search suggestions using Trie
14. ✅ Multiple file tabs using Deque

## Data Structures Used

1. **Doubly Linked List** - Text storage, cursor movement
2. **Stack** - Undo/Redo, Bracket matching
3. **Queue** - Auto-save operations
4. **Trie** - Spell checker, Search suggestions
5. **Deque** - Multiple file tabs
6. **Linked List of Strings** - Line-wise editing
7. **Hash Table (simulated)** - Syntax highlighting

## Files Created/Modified

### Core Data Structures
- `stack.h` / `stack.c` - Stack implementation
- `queue.h` / `queue.c` - Queue implementation
- `trie.h` / `trie.c` - Trie implementation
- `deque.h` / `deque.c` - Deque implementation

### Editor Implementation
- `editor.h` - Enhanced with all feature declarations
- `editor.c` - Complete implementation of all 14 features

### Main Program
